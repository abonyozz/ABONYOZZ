PART 2:
1) The internet standards provide a common language and set of protocols for devices 
and systems to communicate with each other, enabling the exchange of goods and 
services online. Without the IEEE, we might not have standardized protocols for 
wireless communication which would hinder online commerce.
2) Without the W3C: - We might not have standardized protocols for the World Wide 
Web, such as HTML, CSS, and XML.
- Difficult for different devices and systems to communicate and exchange 
information online.
- Hinder the growth of e-commerce, online education, and other online services.
3) The Wi-Fi Alliance's efforts to promote and certify Wi-Fi technology demonstrate 
the importance of networking standards in ensuring interoperability and quality of 
products
